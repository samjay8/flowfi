# FlowFi Architecture

This document explains how FlowFi moves data from on-chain contract events into API responses and real-time frontend updates.

## Core Components

1. Soroban contract: source of truth for stream state and events.
1. Event worker/indexer: reads events from Stellar/Soroban, normalizes payloads, and persists stream state + stream events.
1. PostgreSQL + Prisma: query layer for fast read APIs.
1. Express API: serves versioned REST endpoints and long-lived SSE subscriptions.
1. Frontend: consumes REST for initial state and SSE for real-time deltas.

## Event Type Data Flows

### 1) CREATED

1. Contract emits `CREATED`.
1. Worker inserts `Stream` row with sender, recipient, token, amount/rate/timestamps.
1. Worker inserts `StreamEvent` row.
1. SSE broadcasts `stream.created` to stream and user channels.
1. Frontend refreshes outgoing/incoming lists and summary cards.

### 2) TOPPED_UP

1. Contract emits `TOPPED_UP` with top-up amount.
1. Worker updates `Stream.depositedAmount` and `lastUpdateTime`.
1. Worker inserts `StreamEvent`.
1. SSE broadcasts `stream.topped_up`.
1. Frontend updates TVL/deposit values.

### 3) WITHDRAWN

1. Contract emits `WITHDRAWN` with claimed amount.
1. Worker updates `Stream.withdrawnAmount` and `lastUpdateTime`.
1. Worker inserts `StreamEvent`.
1. SSE broadcasts `stream.withdrawn`.
1. Frontend updates balances and claimable indicators.

### 4) CANCELLED

1. Contract emits `CANCELLED`.
1. Worker marks `Stream.isActive = false` and updates `lastUpdateTime`.
1. Worker inserts `StreamEvent`.
1. SSE broadcasts `stream.cancelled`.
1. Frontend moves stream to historical state.

### 5) COMPLETED

1. Contract emits `COMPLETED` (fully drained lifecycle).
1. Worker marks `Stream.isActive = false`.
1. Worker inserts `StreamEvent`.
1. SSE broadcasts `stream.completed`.
1. Frontend marks stream complete.

### 6) PAUSED / RESUMED

**Database Models:**
- `Stream` - Mirrors on-chain stream state for fast querying
- `StreamEvent` - Stores all on-chain events (CREATED, TOPPED_UP, WITHDRAWN, CANCELLED, COMPLETED)
- `User` - Tracks Stellar wallet addresses
- `IndexerState` - Tracks the last successfully indexed ledger sequence

**Indexer Worker Write Path:**

When the indexer worker processes a ledger batch:

1. Reads the cursor from `IndexerState.lastLedger` to determine where to resume
2. Upserts `Stream` records to mirror on-chain state changes
3. Persists each `StreamEvent` via per-event `findUnique` + `upsert` keyed on `(transactionHash, eventType)` (not batch `createMany` with `skipDuplicates`)
4. Advances `IndexerState.lastLedger` after the batch completes

**Database Model Reference:**

| Model | Key Fields | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| `User` | `publicKey` | Stellar wallet addresses |
| `Stream` | `streamId`, `sender`, `recipient`, `ratePerSecond`, `depositedAmount`, `withdrawnAmount`, `isActive` | Mirrors on-chain stream state |
| `StreamEvent` | `streamId`, `eventType`, `transactionHash`, `ledgerSequence`, `timestamp` | Indexed on-chain events; unique on `(transactionHash, eventType)` |
| `IndexerState` | `lastLedger` | Cursor for last successfully indexed ledger sequence |

Paused behavior:

1. On `PAUSED`, worker stores pause start metadata and stream remains non-progressing.
1. On `RESUMED`, worker computes paused interval duration and accumulates `totalPausedSeconds`.
1. Claimable calculations use effective elapsed time:

$$
\text{effectiveElapsed} = \max(0,\, now - lastUpdateTime - totalPausedSecondsSinceLastUpdate)
$$

$$
\text{streamed} = \text{effectiveElapsed} \times \text{ratePerSecond}
$$

$$
\text{claimable} = \min(\text{streamed},\, depositedAmount - withdrawnAmount)
$$

This prevents paused periods from increasing claimable balance.

## Pause/Resume Timing Model

Rules used by backend/domain logic:

1. Time is tracked in Unix seconds.
1. Claimable only advances while stream is active and not paused.
1. Multiple pause/resume intervals are cumulative.
1. Resume re-baselines time accounting so no double counting occurs.
1. Cancellation/completion finalizes stream and halts further accrual.

## Authentication Flow

See [Authentication Documentation](../backend/docs/AUTHENTICATION.md) for full details.

    FE->>API: Verify signature
    API-->>FE: JWT token
    FE->>SSE: Subscribe with Bearer JWT
    SSE-->>FE: Connected + real-time events
```

## SSE in Single vs Multi-Instance Mode

Single instance:

1. API writes SSE event directly to in-memory client registry.

Multi-instance (recommended for horizontal scale):

1. Instance A receives event and publishes to Redis channels (`sse:stream:*`, `sse:user:*`).
1. All API instances subscribe to matching channels.
1. Each instance rebroadcasts to its own connected clients.

Benefits:

1. Real-time fanout works across replicas.
1. Sticky sessions are not required for event delivery.
1. API replicas can scale independently while preserving SSE correctness.

## Operational Notes

1. `/v1/events/stats` exposes active SSE connections and connection-capacity metrics.
2. Admin metrics include SSE peak-per-IP visibility for abuse monitoring.
3. User summary endpoint (`/v1/users/{address}/summary`) is cached for 30s to protect DB hot paths.

## Logging & Observability

All backend log lines use standard JSON formatting via Winston and include a `requestId` correlation ID field when running inside a request or worker context (managed by Node's `AsyncLocalStorage` via `requestContext` in `backend/src/logger.ts`).

- **HTTP Requests:** Requests receive or generate a `requestId` via `requestIdMiddleware` (`X-Request-ID` header).
- **Background Indexer/Worker Poll Cycles:** Each `SorobanEventWorker` poll batch runs inside `requestContext.run({ requestId: randomUUID() }, ...)` so all RPC fetches, event processing, and per-event error logs within that poll cycle share a single correlation ID.
- **Admin Replays:** Triggering an indexer event replay (via `replayFromLedger` or `POST /v1/admin/indexer/replay`) wraps the reset and worker poll cycle in `requestContext`. The correlation ID is included on all log statements emitted during replay and returned in the HTTP API response (`{ ok: true, replayingFrom: <ledger>, requestId: "<id>" }`).

### Indexer Ownership & Naming

Two files share the `indexer` name, but only one of them is the indexer that writes stream state. This section documents which is the source of truth so contributors know where to start when debugging indexing.

| File | Role | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| `backend/src/workers/soroban-event-worker.ts` (`SorobanEventWorker`) | **Source-of-truth indexer.** Polls Soroban RPC, decodes XDR, persists `Stream` / `StreamEvent`, advances the `IndexerState` cursor, and broadcasts SSE. | Active / source of truth. Started by `backend/src/workers/index.ts` |
| `backend/src/services/indexerService.ts` | **Not an indexer at all.** Admin control-plane helpers (`getIndexerStatus`, `resetIndexer`, `replayFromLedger`) that read/reset `IndexerState` and trigger the worker's poll loop. | Active. The name is misleading. |

Key points:

1. **When debugging indexing, read `backend/src/workers/soroban-event-worker.ts` first.** It is the only file that persists canonical stream state.
2. **`indexerService.ts` is control-plane only** — it never reads the chain; it manages the shared cursor and triggers replays.

**Naming convention plan:** the team convention is kebab-case with a `.service.ts` suffix (e.g. `claimable.service.ts`, `sse.service.ts`). The helper file `indexerService.ts` breaks that convention and is also a misleading name. It is expected to be renamed to `indexer.service.ts`.

### Deduplication

`StreamEvent` rows carry a compound unique constraint:

```
@@unique([transactionHash, eventType])
```

This means replaying the same on-chain transaction (e.g. during a re-index or worker restart) will produce an `upsert` conflict rather than a duplicate row. The worker uses Prisma's `createOrUpdate` (upsert) path on `Stream` and a `createMany … skipDuplicates` path on `StreamEvent`.

### Indexer Cursor — `IndexerState`

The worker persists its progress in the `IndexerState` table (a single-row ledger-sequence cursor). On each poll cycle:

1. Read the stored `lastIndexedLedger` value.
2. Query the Soroban RPC for events emitted in `(lastIndexedLedger, latestLedger]`.
3. Process and persist events.
4. Update `IndexerState.lastIndexedLedger` to `latestLedger`.

On a cold start (no `IndexerState` row) the worker begins from a configured genesis ledger so historical streams are backfilled.

### Stale-Read Fallback

When the DB row for a stream was last updated more than a configurable threshold ago (`isStale` check in `backend/src/services/sorobanService.ts`), the API falls back to a live Soroban RPC call instead of serving the cached DB value. This keeps claimable-balance figures accurate even if the indexer lags.

## Action Signing Model

FlowFi actions split into two categories based on who holds the signing key:

| Action | Signer | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Top-up** | Server (custodial) | Backend submits the transaction using `KEEPER_SECRET_KEY`. The frontend sends only the stream ID and amount. |
| **Withdraw** | Wallet (non-custodial) | Frontend builds and signs the transaction via the connected wallet (Freighter). The backend currently only simulates server-side; the real transaction is signed and submitted by the frontend. |
| **Pause / Resume** | Wallet (non-custodial) | Same as withdraw — frontend-signed. The backend simulate endpoints exist for fee estimation but do not submit. |
| **Create stream** | Wallet (non-custodial) | Frontend signs via wallet and submits directly to the RPC. |

> **Important for contributors:** Do not wire pause/resume/withdraw to a server-side submit path. Only `top-up` is intentionally custodial. All other mutating actions must be wallet-signed by the user.
